  "course_description": "5.32 involves more advanced experimental work than 5.310 or 5.311. The course emphasizes organic synthesis assisted by chiral catalysis, purification, and analysis of organic compounds employing such methods as IR, 1D and 2D NMR, UV spectroscopies and mass spectrometry, and thin layer and non-chiral and chiral gas chromatography.\u00a0In 5.32,\u00a0experiments also involve enzyme purification, characterization and assays, as well as molecular modeling in organic synthesis and in biochemical systems.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in these materials are potentially hazardous and require a high level of safety training, special facilities and equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals. You bear the sole responsibility, liability, and risk for the implementation of such safety procedures and measures.
